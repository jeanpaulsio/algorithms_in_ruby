# Problem:
# Do a binary search on an array with unknown length.
#   Assume that you can't use that there are no nil values in the array
#   since Ruby does not throw an ArrayOutOfBoundsException if you try to
#   access an index that does not exist.
#
#   arr = [1, 2, 3]
#   arr[50] => nil

class UnknownLength
  def self.run(arr, target:)
